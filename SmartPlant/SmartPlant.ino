 *  John has many plants on the balcony of his house. These plants require constant attention and caring. He has to water them when they require, add fertilizers and pesticide.
 * 
 * One of the most tedious tasks that John has to do is to keep the plantsâ€™ soil moist at all times. Otherwise the plants will not be in good shape and may not survive. John 
 * has become very busy these days and with his age it is hard for him to keep record and remember when to water the plants. He is looking for a smart solution to notify him 
 * when the plants need to be watered. Such a solution needs to provide a notification using an LED light connected to the pot to turn on and indicate when the soil moisture 
 * is below a certain limit.
 *

 * Assumptions
 * 0    ~ 300     dry soil 
 * 300  ~ 700     humid soil
 * 700  ~ 950     in water
